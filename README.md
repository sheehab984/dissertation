# Multi Threshold Directional Change Optimization using GA

This project implements three different strategies for optimization using a genetic algorithm. The strategies are implemented in the `Strategy1.py`, `Strategy2.py`, and `Strategy3.py` files. The `run_ga_2.py` and `run_ga_2n.py` files can be used to run the optimization using a single threshold or multiple thresholds, respectively.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git`
2. Move to the main branch: `git checkout main`
3. Create a virtual environment or use an Anaconda environment
4. Install packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

To run the optimization using a single threshold, use the `run_ga_<id>.py` file. To run the optimization using multiple thresholds, use the `run_ga_<id>n.py` file. The `Strategy1.py`, `Strategy2.py`, and `Strategy3.py` files contain the implementation for each strategy.

This project was run using a Cluster Grid Engine, and the `.sh` files are used to start those executions.
